# hello-world
Tutorial Repository with goals and reasons for making this hub as well as any ideas that I come up with that I would like to try. 

My Name is Patrick Hsu, but any gaming handles I use usually go by ChainOS. I'm sophmore at University of Arizona currently trying to pursue a double major in Neuroscience and Cognitive science as well as Computer Programming, though I'm doing rather poorly in the latter. 

I think I'll use this as kind of an update for general happenings and my thoughts and feelings on coding as well as general ideas of what i want to make. As well as dates for all my messages and stuff. This hub was created on January 14, 2020 and hopefully is the first of many here.
